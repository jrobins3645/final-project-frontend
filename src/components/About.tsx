            Tyson always been interested in an aesthetic genre that implemented
            many elements from the User Interfaces of old Windows machines. This
            eventually lead Tyson to making modifications to the User Interface
            of his own Windows machine to have the same aesthetic that he was
            obsessed with. The process of that is what introduced Tyson to
            Software Development, and he's been passionate about Software
            Development ever since. After joining Grand Circus, Tyson progressed
            rapidly when it comes to learning things like JavaScript,
            Typescript, React, MongoDB, etc. It has overall lead Tyson to
            becoming more interested in the possibilities that they unlock.

            Andrew started teaching himself programming about 17 years ago when
            he wanted to make a homepage for his dog. He then became interested
            in Roblox and started programming with that. He started taking
            formal classes and courses about 14 years ago, and has continued
            taking them since then, as well as working on countless
            side-projects. Andrew compares programming to puzzle solving, such
            as Sudoku. Trying to find the best and most robust solutions to
            solving a problem is satisfying for him. There are puzzle games
            inspired by this connection to programming, such as Shenzhen IO,
            Hacknet, and TIS-100, and many others, all of which Andrew enjoys.
            Andrew loves doing work that he finds enjoyable and satisfying.

            Before diving into a career of web development, Jeff spent years in
            the hospitality industry. Jeff then spent time working as an
            installation technician where he used software that was often
            unintuitive and clunky. That was when he decided to enroll in Grand
            Circusâ€™s JavaScript course with the goal of creating intuitive
            software that anyone can use. Jeff's experience in hospitality has
            taught him the value of working with a wide-array of people in a
            fast-paced environment, which will help him accomplish challenges
            with different teams and clients. Jeff is excited to utilize the
            technical skills gained at Grand Circus and work with a team of
            like-minded individuals to hone his skills as a junior developer.
